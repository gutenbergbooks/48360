<p class="p0">F THE mistakes commonly made in home
building none is more frequent than faulty design
and construction of chimneys and fireplaces.
Though the use of the fireplace is one of the oldest
methods of house heating there are few who understand
the principles of its action, and even experienced
masons frequently fall into errors in building
which seriously detract from the efficiency of the
installation. No defect in the construction of the
house detracts more from the comfort of the home
and none is a greater menace to life and property
than a poor chimney and fireplace. Bad chimney
design is also the cause of much avoidable expense
in heating the house.</p>

<p>This bulletin is designed to give the householder
and prospective builder, and especially the farmer
or other rural resident who builds or superintends
the building of his own home, a working knowledge
of the principles to be observed in planning and
building these important parts of the house, which,
if they are observed, will go a long way to promote
the comfort of the home and insure the safety of the
property.</p>

</div>

<p class="p0">HE prime function of a chimney is to produce a draft that
will cause sufficient combustion and carry off the resulting
smoke; incidentally it assists ventilation. Many
unsatisfactory heating plants and much excessive fuel
consumption are due to improperly constructed chimneys,
which are the rule rather than the exception. Although many of
these are more inefficient than dangerous, yet reports of the National
Board of Fire Underwriters<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> show that a larger number of fires are
caused by defective chimney construction than by anything else. The
annual loss resulting from such fires is greater than the fire loss from
any other cause. Poor chimney construction is responsible for smoke
pollution of the air, waste of fuel, and poor heating.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> &ldquo;Dwelling Houses,&rdquo; a publication issued by the National Board of Fire Underwriters
in the interest of fire protection, has been used as a basis for the matter relating to the
requirements and construction of chimneys and methods of fire protection.</p></div>

<p>The most common faults in chimney construction are:</p>

<p>1. The use of unsuitable materials. Clay sewer pipe, hollow
building blocks, or unprotected concrete should not be used.</p>

<p>2. Improper laying of brick. Brick should not be laid on edge
and should be properly bonded. Lining should be used in all brick
chimneys the walls of which are less than 8 inches thick. Lack
of mortar, especially in the perpendicular joints, ruins many an
otherwise good chimney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span></p>

<p>3. Failure to support the chimney properly. It should never be
carried on any timber construction of the building, and when it rests
upon the ground sufficient masonry foundation should be provided
to prevent settling.</p>

<p>4. Building inflammable material into the chimney or against it
without proper insulation.</p>

<p>5. Failure to anchor the smoke pipe properly to the chimney.</p>

<p>6. Neglect of the connection between smoke pipe and flue or of
the flue itself. The connection should be tight; rusted pipe should
be replaced; the chimney should be kept clean and the joints in the
brickwork properly pointed.</p>

<p>7. Lack of a tight flue. A flue free from leakage is unusual.
Every flue should be tight enough to prevent escape of smoke when
tested as described on page 14. A leaky flue is the most frequent
cause of heating troubles, high fuel bills, and destructive fires.</p>

<p>8. Failure to maintain the full sectional area at the bend when a
flue is offset.</p>

<p>9. Use of the main heating apparatus flue for water heater or
other auxiliary equipment. The furnace or heater should have a
separate flue.</p>

<p>10. Failure to provide a separate tight cleanout for each flue.
Two or more otherwise good flues may be rendered inefficient if
led into one cleanout, since air may be drawn from one into another
and the draft in all affected.</p>

<p>11. Presence of deep pockets leading to cleanouts. They may cause
eddying currents that are detrimental. Pockets should be only
deep enough to permit installing a cast-iron cleanout frame and
door just below the smoke pipe entrance. Deep pockets allow soot
accumulation that may take fire.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_CHIMNEY_DRAFT"></a>THE CHIMNEY DRAFT.</p>

<p>The draft depends entirely upon the chimney flue. The better
the flue the more satisfactory and efficient will be the operation of
the entire heating apparatus. The strength or intensity of the draft
is dependent mainly upon the tightness, size, and height of the
chimney flue. The most common error in chimney construction is
failure to distinguish between the size of flue necessary for free
passage of the volume of smoke from a given amount of fuel and
that which with proper height will produce the required draft. A
chimney may be high enough, yet have an area too small to carry
properly the volume of smoke. On the other hand, the size may
be sufficient but the chimney too low to produce a draft strong
enough to pull the air through the fire at a sufficiently rapid rate.
Either fault or a combination of the two will result in unsatisfactory
service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span></p>

<p>Draft in a chimney flue is caused by the difference in weight between
a volume of air on the outside and an equal volume of products
of combustion from the fire on the inside. The higher the temperature
of a given weight of air, the greater is its total volume and the
lighter the weight of its unit volume. This produces a condition of
unbalanced pressures at the base of the flue. The rising of the lighter
gases within the chimney tends to equalize the pressures. So long
as the fire burns this condition of unbalanced pressure persists, the
result being draft.</p>

<p>This is the basic principle which governs chimney action and upon
which the draft depends. The greater the difference between the
temperature in the flue and that outside the greater the tendency
toward equalization of pressure and hence the better the draft. In
summer the draft of a chimney is not as good as in winter because
the difference in temperature between the outside air and that of the
gases in the flue is less.</p>

<p class="hanging">Fig. 1.&mdash;Round flues offer the least resistance to

</div>
</div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SHAPES_AND_SIZES_OF_FLUES"></a>SHAPES AND SIZES OF FLUES.</p>

<p>The most efficient chimney is one built perfectly straight with a
round or nearly round flue and a smooth interior surface. There is
no advantage in reducing
the sectional area toward
the top. The cross section
and height are determining
factors. The transverse
area must be sufficient to
pass the volume of air required
to burn the fuel
properly, and the height must be great enough to insure against
interference with the draft by adjoining buildings or projections of
the same building and to produce a sufficiently strong draft.</p>

<a id="fig2" name="fig2"></a>
<img src="images/fig_2.png" width="429" height="231" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">
<p class="hanging">Fig. 2.&mdash;Top of chimney should be at least 2 feet above the
top of ridge in order that the wind currents may not be
deflected down the chimney.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Loss in draft strength is due to air leakage, and friction of the
gases against the sides of the chimney. A round flue (see <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>)
is the most desirable because it offers less resistance to the spirally
ascending column of smoke and gases. The elliptical is second choice
so far as the movement of the gases is concerned, but the difficulties
that it presents in manufacture and construction eliminate this shape.
A rectangular chimney either square or oblong is not effective over its
full transverse area; for the rising column, being approximately
circular in section, does not fill the corners. However, square or
oblong forms are far more common than the round, owing to the
greater cost of round flue construction. Square flues are preferable
to oblong so far as efficiency is concerned, but in the larger sizes of
house flues the oblong shape is more generally used because it fits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
to better advantage into the plan of the house. An oblong flue
should never have the long side more than 4 inches greater than the
short side. A flue 8 inches by 16 inches is bad flue construction for
draft purposes. The sizes given in <a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a> are recommended by the
National Warm Air Heating and Ventilating Association. Like all
data for both high and low pressure flues, these sizes are based on
experience, not on scientific data, and are subject to modification by
further research. The dimensions given are for unlined flues. The
actual inside dimensions of flue tile are slightly different because of the
lack of standardization. In selecting the flue for a furnace or other
large heating unit an 8-inch by 12-inch size should be considered the
minimum for a lined or unlined flue, and 12 inches by 12 inches the
minimum for a lined or unlined flue whose height is more than 35
feet measured above
the grate level. If
the chimney is designed for a small
unit such as a laundry stove or kitchen
range an 8-inch by
8-inch flue may be
used.</p>

<p>The proper size of
flue depends upon
the size of the heater
or furnace for which
is to be used. All manufacturers' catalogues contain the
size of the smoke pipe for each particular heater, and from
<a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a> (minimum) dimensions for round, square, and oblong flues
may be selected; or if the catalogue contains stack sizes select the
proper one. The flue tile to be used should have a transverse net
inside area approximately equal to that of the smoke pipe.</p>

<p class="caption3" style="padding-top: 2em"><a id="HEIGHT_OF_CHIMNEY"></a>HEIGHT OF CHIMNEY.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a> the minimum height of the chimney above the grate is
given as 35 feet. Higher chimneys are considered more satisfactory,
and authorities claim that any flue under 40 feet in height will produce
an erratic draft, good on some days but poor on others The
force or direction of the wind may be the cause, or the amount of
moisture in the air, or the
quality of the fuel may be
responsible. The higher the
chimney the less will be the
possibility of counter air
currents and the stronger
and more constant the draft.
Soft coal and the sizes of
hard coal known as pea and
buckwheat are apt to cake
and fill up the air spaces
through the bed of the
fire, with the result that
an intense draft is required
to give the fuel sufficient
air.</p>

<p>The top of the chimney
should extend at least 3 feet
above flat roofs and 2 feet
above the ridge of peak roofs
(see figs. <a href="#fig2">2</a> and <a href="#fig3">3</a>), and it
should not be on the side of
the house adjacent to a large
tree or a structure higher
than itself (see <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>), for
these may Cause eddies and
force air down the chimney.
A poor draft will most likely result when the wind is blowing in the
direction indicated.</p>

<p>Although chimneys are built unlined to save expense, those properly
lined with tile are undoubtedly more efficient. Linings prevent
disintegration of mortar and bricks through the action of flue gases.
This disintegration and that occurring from changes in temperature
result frequently in open cracks in the flue (see <a href="#fig5">fig. 5-B</a>) which
reduce or check the draft. If loose brick and mortar should fall
within they may lodge so as to cause partial or almost complete
stoppage (see <a href="#fig5">fig. 5-D</a>). The danger of this latter condition is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
greater if the flue be built with offsets or bends. Any change in
direction should be made as gradual as possible and with an angle
not greater than 30 degrees with the perpendicular.</p>

<p>The most important requirement for a flue lining is that it withstand
high temperatures and not be subject to disintegration by ordinary
flue gases. It should be made of fire clay and for the purpose.
The thickness should be 1 inch. It should be set in cement mortar
with the joints struck smooth on the inside. Each length of flue
lining should be placed in position, and the brick should then be
laid around it; if the lining is slipped down after several courses of
brick have been laid, the joints can not properly be filled with mortar
and leakage is almost sure
to result.</p>

<p>Well-burned clay flue
linings are generally satisfactory for dwelling-house
chimneys used for stoves,
ranges, fireplaces, and furnaces. In regions where
the fuel is natural gas, hot
flue gases are said to have
caused linings to disintegrate and crumble off. In
such a case it may be necessary to use a fire clay
that has stood the test or
line the chimney with fire
brick.</p>

<p>Linings are manufactured in round, square, and oblong shapes, but
not in elliptical. The oblong and square shapes are better adapted
to brick construction than the round. They permit of simpler and
less expensive masonry work. On the other hand, the round shape
produces better draft and is easier to clean.</p>

<p>A fireplace flue, if straight, should be lined from the throat continuously
to the top. The smoke chamber should be lined with fire
clay or cement mortar one-half inch thick. In case the masonry in
front of the throat is less than 8 inches thick the lining should start
at the bottom of the lintel. The hottest part of the flue is at its throat,
and if it is not lined at that point or if the masonry is not of sufficient
thickness, there is danger of overheating. Careful attention should
be given to details of flue construction in order to assure satisfactory
operation and reduce the fire hazard.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="LOCATION_AND_WALL_THICKNESS"></a>LOCATION AND WALL THICKNESS.</p>

<p>The best location for the chimney is near the center of the building,
for when so located its four walls are kept warm; cold winds can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
not chill it and cause it to draw poorly. However, it is not always
possible to plan the arrangement of rooms so that the chimney may
be thus located. The outside wall of a chimney should be at least
8 inches thick in order to reduce heat loss and the chance of air leakage
into the flue.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 321px;">

<div class="fig_caption">
<p class="hanging">Fig. 5.&mdash;A. An unlined chimney before use.

Frequently the heat and weather cause

become lodged at the offset during construction or loosening of the points and
disintegration may cause bricks from an
uncapped chimney to check the draft completely.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the flue is lined and the chimney is not higher than 30 feet, its
walls, if of brick, may be made
4 inches thick, provided adjacent
inflammable material is properly insulated. If unlined, the
walls should not be less than 8
inches thick. It is not good
practice to place the linings of
two flues side by side. If there
is more than one flue in a chimney, the flues should be separated
from each other by a division wall of brick at least 4
inches thick (see <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>), bonded
into the side walls, and the joints
of the flue linings should be
staggered or offset at least 6
inches (see <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). This construction insures stability, reduces
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the chance for air leakage between flues, and prevents</span>
the possibility of a fire in one
flue involving an adjacent flue.
If stone is used in chimney construction, the walls should be at
least 4 inches thicker than brick
walls.</p>

<p>Walls of concrete chimneys
should be not less than 4 inches
thick or else they should be
reinforced in both directions;
otherwise cracking during the
setting of the concrete or, later, due to temperature changes or unequal
settlement of the foundation is apt to occur. Concrete blocks
are not recommended, but if they are used each block should be reinforced
with steel running continuously around it and the blocks
should be not less than 4 inches thick. They should be lined with the
best flue lining. All monolithic concrete chimneys with walls less
than 8 inches thick should be lined.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="OPENINGS_INTO_THE_CHIMNEY"></a>OPENINGS INTO THE CHIMNEY.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to find an opening into a chimney other than for
the smoke pipe of the main heating apparatus. This is a frequent
cause of unsatisfactory operation. No range, stove, fireplace, or
ventilating register should be connected with the chimney flue built
for the heating apparatus. If it should be desired to use an existing
abandoned fireplace chimney for a range or stove the fireplace flue
should be closed tight about a foot below the place where the smoke pipe
enters.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 251px;">

<div class="fig_caption">
<p class="hanging">Fig. 6.&mdash;A division wall of at least
4 inches of brick should separate
each flue from any others in the
same chimney. Either of the
arrangements shown will produce a good bond.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There should be but one connection
with a flue, if for no other reason than
to decrease the fire hazard. Fires frequently occur from sparks that pass
into the flue through one opening and
out through another. Two stoves, one
on the first floor and one on the second,
may be connected with the same chimney flue, but if the fire in the upper
stove is hotter than in the lower, the
lower will have practically no draft.</p>

<p>A soot pocket provided with a door
for cleaning it out is very convenient. The door should be placed just below the smoke pipe opening,
and care must be taken to see that it fits snugly and is always closed
so tight that no air can get in.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SUPPORTING_THE_CHIMNEY"></a>SUPPORTING THE CHIMNEY.</p>

<p>All chimneys should be built from the ground up. None of the
weight should be carried by any part of the building except the
foundation. Proper foundations should be provided at least 12
inches wider all round than the chimney. If the chimney is an exterior one,
and there is no basement or cellar, its foundation should
be started well below the frost line. Otherwise the base of the
chimney should be at the same level as the bottom of the foundation
of the building.</p>

<p>No chimney should rest upon or be carried by wooden floors,
beams, or brackets, nor should it be hung from wooden rafters. Wood
construction shrinks, and beams supporting heavy loads always deflect
in time. Sagging of the beams injures the walls and ceilings of
the house and is apt to crack the chimney and render it dangerous.
Chimneys usually extend several feet above the roof, exposing considerable
surface to the wind, and unless the support is stable they
are likely to sway during a gale with the possibility of the joints at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
the roof-line opening. Openings in a flue at this point are especially
dangerous, for sparks from the flue may come into contact with the
woodwork of the roof. This swaying may also cause leaks in the
roof.</p>

When the chimney contains two flues the joints should be separated as shown.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The brickwork around all fireplaces and flues should be laid with
cement mortar, as it is more resistant than lime mortar to the action
of heat and flue gases. It is well to use cement mortar for the
entire chimney construction. All mortar used for chimney construction,
except for laying firebrick, should be proportioned as follows:
Two bags of Portland cement, not less than 188 pounds, and one bag
of dry hydrated lime, 50 pounds, thoroughly mixed dry, and to this
mixture should be added three times its volume of clean sand with
sufficient water to produce proper consistency. When dry hydrated
lime is not available, 1 cubic foot of completely slaked lime putty
may be substituted for the dry hydrate.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="CAPPING_THE_CHIMNEY"></a>CAPPING THE CHIMNEY.</p>

<p>Brick chimneys should be capped with stone, concrete, or cast-iron.
Unless a chimney is capped the top courses of brick may become
loosened and therefore dangerous. Plain topped chimneys
will last longer and are safer than those of an ornamental character.
The opening in the cap piece should be the full size of the flue.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="CHIMNEY_AND_ROOF_CONNECTION"></a>CHIMNEY AND ROOF CONNECTION.</p>

<p>Where the chimney passes through the roof the construction
should provide space for expansion due to temperature changes,
settlement, or slight movement of the chimney during heavy winds.
(See <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>.) Copper is the best material for flashings. It is easier
to handle than galvanized sheet-metal, which is more often used
because of its lesser cost, but which will corrode in time, both from
inside and outside exposure. Tin or black iron are cheaper but will
rust quickly unless frequently painted. Lead and zinc are expensive
and should not be used for chimney flashings, for in case of fire
under the roof they will melt and leave an opening to create a draft
by which the intensity of the fire will be increased.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="CHIMNEY_CONNECTIONS"></a>CHIMNEY CONNECTIONS.</p>

<p>Proper care in setting and looking after smoke pipes connecting
with chimneys would greatly lessen the number of fires chargeable
to defective construction.</p>

<p>In fitting the smoke pipe no opening should be left around it, and
the pipe should not project into the flue lining. (See <a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>.) The
joint should be made air-tight by a closely fitting collar and boiler
putty or fireproof cement. The proper construction is shown in <a href="#fig8">figure 8-B</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
but if the pipe extends into the flue a shelf is formed on
which soot will accumulate, the flue area will be reduced and a poor
draft may result.</p>

<p>Smoke pipes should enter the chimney horizontally, and the connection
through the chimney wall to the flue should be made with
fire clay or metal thimbles securely and tightly set in the masonry.
If the walls are furred, no wood should be within 12 inches of
thimbles or any part of the smoke pipe. The space between the
thimble and wood furring should be covered with metal lath and
plaster.</p>

<p>Flue holes when not in use should be closed with tight fitting
metal covers. If the room is papered the metal covers may also be
papered, provided there is no
other smoke connection with the
flue, or provided a protective
coating of asbestos paper is first
applied over the metal. If there
is another connection the metal
may become hot enough to
scorch the unprotected wall
paper or set it afire. No smoke
pipe should be permitted within
18 inches of any woodwork unless
at least that half of the pipe
nearest the woodwork is protected
properly by 1 inch or
more of fireproof covering. A
metal casing 2 inches from the
upper half of the pipe is sometimes
employed to protect woodwork
directly above it. When a smoke pipe is so protected
it should never be less than 9 inches from any woodwork or combustible
material. The storage of wooden boxes, barrels, or any
combustible should not be permitted under or near a furnace smoke
Pipe.</p>

<p>If a smoke pipe must be carried through a wood partition the
woodwork should be properly protected. This can be done by cutting
an opening in the partition and inserting a galvanized iron
double-walled ventilating thimble at least 12 inches larger than the
smoke pipe (see <a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>), or protection may be afforded by at least 4
inches of brickwork or other incombustible material. Smoke pipes
should not pass through floors, closets, or concealed spaces. They
should not enter a chimney in a garret. They should be cleaned at
least once a year.</p>

<p>All wooden construction adjacent to chimneys should be insulated.
A space of 2 inches should be left between the outside face of a chimney

well. (See <a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>.) Do not use brickwork,

done before the floor is laid, as it not only forms
a fire stop but prevents accumulation of shavings

<p class="caption3"><a id="SMOKE_TEST_FOR_LEAKAGE"></a>SMOKE TEST FOR LEAKAGE.</p>

<p>Every flue should be subjected to a smoke test before the heater is
connected with it. This may be done as follows: Build a paper,
straw, wood, or tar-paper fire at the base
of the flue, and when the smoke is passing
in a dense column tightly block the
outlet at the top by laying a wet blanket
over it. If leakage exists at any point,
it will immediately become apparent by
the appearance of smoke at the opening. Flues so tested frequently
reveal very bad leaks into adjoining flues or directly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
through the walls or between the linings and the wall. When the
smoke test indicates leakage, the defect should be remedied before
the chimney is accepted for use. Remedying such defects is usually
difficult, hence it is wise to watch the construction closely as it progresses.
Many brick masons say that all flues leak. This is not true;
every flue should be tight.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="CLEANING_AND_REPAIRING_THE_FLUE"></a>CLEANING AND REPAIRING THE FLUE.</p>

<p>If a smoke test shows no leakage and the flue is straight, a hand
mirror held at the proper angle at the base affords a means of examination
for obstructions. Usual causes of stoppage are broken tile
leaning inward, mortar accumulations, loose bricks, bird&rsquo;s nests,
partly burned paper, soot from soft coal, tarry deposits from burning
wood, etc. A weighted bag of hay or straw attached to the end of a
rope may be passed up and down the flue to clean it if there is not too
great an offset in it.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a id="FIREPLACES"></a>FIREPLACES.</p>

<p>The use of the fireplace is a very old method of house heating.
As ordinarily constructed fireplaces are not efficient and economical.
The only warming effect is produced by the heat given off by radiation
from the back, sides, and hearth of the fireplace. Practically
no heating effect is produced by convection; that is, by air currents.
The air passes through the fire, is heated, and passes up the chimney,
carrying with it the heat required to raise its temperature from that
at which it entered the room and at the same time drawing into
the room outside air of a lower temperature. The effect of the cold
air thus brought into the room is particularly noticeable in parts of
the room farthest from the fire.</p>

<p>The open fireplace, however, has its place as an auxiliary to the
heating plant and for the hominess that a burning fire imparts to
the room. If one is to be provided, the essentials of construction
should be understood and followed so that it will not smoke.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="ESSENTIALS_OF_FIREPLACE_CONSTRUCTION"></a>ESSENTIALS OF FIREPLACE CONSTRUCTION.</p>

<p>In order that satisfactory results may be obtained from an open
fireplace, it is essential: First, that the flue have the proper area;
second, that the throat be correctly proportioned and located; third,
that a properly-constructed smoke shelf and chamber be provided;
fourth, that the chimney be carried high enough to avoid interference;
and fifth, that the shape of the fireplace be such as to direct
a maximum amount of radiated heat into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="AREA_OF_THE_FLUE"></a>AREA OF THE FLUE.</p>

<p>The sectional area of the flue bears a direct relation to the area of
the fireplace opening. The area of lined flues should be a tenth or
more of that of the fireplace opening. If the flues are unlined the
proportion should be increased slightly because of greater friction.
Thirteen square inches of area for the chimney flue to every square
foot of fireplace opening is a good rule to follow. For the fireplace
shown in <a href="#fig13">figure 13-A</a>, the opening of which has an area of 8.25
square feet, there is required a flue having an area of 107 square
inches. If this flue were built of brick and unlined it would probably
be made 8 inches by 16 inches, or 128 square inches, because
brickwork can be laid to better advantage when the dimensions of
the flue are multiples of 4 inches. If the flue is lined the lining
should have an inside area approximating 107 square inches. It is
seldom possible to secure lining having the exact required area, but
the clear area should never be less than that prescribed above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span></p>

<p>Failure to provide a chimney flue of sufficient sectional area is in
many instances the cause of an unsatisfactory fireplace. The cross
section should be the same throughout the entire length of the chimney.
Do not contract the flue at the chimney top, for that would nullify
the larger opening below; if it is necessary to change the direction
of a flue the full area should be preserved through all turns and
bends, and the change should be made as gradual as possible.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_THROAT"></a>THE THROAT.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 183px;">

<div class="fig_caption">
<p class="hanging">Fig. 14.&mdash;Fireplaces constructed like this without
throat will very likely smoke.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#fig13">figure 13-B</a> is shown the throat, the narrow opening between
the fireplace and the smoke chamber. Correct throat construction
contributes more to efficiency than any other
feature except proper flue design. A flue twice
as large as is necessary brought straight down
to the fireplace without constriction at the throat
would result in a poor draft, for the draft does
not depend upon the largeness of the flue but
upon its proper proportioning to the fireplace
and throat. The arrows indicate the upward
flowing currents of warm air which are thrown
forward at the throat and pass through the
smoke chamber into the flue on the inner side.
This rapid upward passage of air causes a down
current on the opposite side, as indicated by the
descending arrows. The down current is not
nearly as strong as the up current, but it may
be of such force that if there be no throat to the
fireplace (see <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>) to increase the velocity
of the upward current by constricting it, the
meeting of the two currents will result in smoke
being forced out into the room. Thus it frequently
happens that a fireplace has an ample
flue area and yet smokes badly. The influence
of the throat upon the upward and downward air currents is shown
in <a href="#fig13">figure 13-B</a>.</p>

<p>The area of the throat should not be less than that of the flue.
Its length should always be equal to the width of the fireplace opening.
(See <a href="#fig13">fig. 13-A</a>.) The sides of the fireplace should be vertical
until the throat is passed. (DD in <a href="#fig13">fig. 13-A</a>.) Above the
throat the sides should be drawn in until the desired flue area is
attained. The throat should be set 8 inches above the location of
the lintel, as shown in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>, A and B. The wrong way to place
the throat damper is shown in <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>. The throat should not be
more than 4 or 5 inches wide. The lesser width is a safe standard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
If a damper is installed the width of the brick opening at the throat
will depend upon the width of the frame of the damper, the width
of the throat proper being regulated by the hinged cover of the
damper. If the throat damper is omitted the opening should be
4 inches, as shown in <a href="#fig16">figure 16</a>. The smoke shelf should not be
bricked up but should conform to the dotted lines. The depth of the
smoke shelf should be the same for a 2-foot as for a 10-foot fireplace
opening.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 188px;">

<div class="fig_caption">

</div>
</div>

<p>Proper throat construction is so necessary to a successful fireplace
that the work should be carefully watched to see that the width
is not made more than 4 inches and that the
side walls are carried up perpendicularly until
the throat is passed, so that the full length
of opening is provided. All masons do not
appreciate these fine but necessary points.
Many prefer their own and sometimes will
ignore the proper methods. It is therefore
advisable to inspect the work several times a
day as it progresses and thus avoid poor results.
When trouble is experienced in an existing
fireplace that has ample flue area, it is
usually found that the formation of the throat
is the cause.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SMOKE_SHELF_AND_CHAMBER"></a>SMOKE SHELF AND CHAMBER.</p>

<p>A smoke shelf and chamber are absolutely
essential. The shelf is formed by setting the
brickwork back at the top of the throat to the
line of the flue wall. The shelf should be the
full length of the throat. The depth of the
shelf should be not less than 4 inches. It may
vary from this to 12 or more, depending upon
the depth of the fireplace.</p>

<p>The purpose of the smoke shelf is to change
the direction of the down draft so that the
hot gases at the throat will strike it approximately
at a right angle instead of head on.
Therefore the shelf should not be bricked up as shown in figures
<a href="#fig15">15</a> and <a href="#fig16">16</a>, but should be made as wide as the construction
will permit at a height of 8 inches above the top of the fireplace
opening.</p>

<p>The smoke chamber is the space extending from the top of the
throat up to the bottom of the flue proper and between the side walls,
which may be drawn in after the top of the throat is passed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
area at the bottom of the chamber is quite large, since its width
includes that of the throat added to the depth of the smoke shelf.
This space is capable of holding accumulated smoke temporarily
in case a gust of wind across the top of the chimney momentarily
cuts off the draft. Smoke might be forced into the room if there
were no reservoir to hold it. The smoke chamber also lessens the
force of the down draft by increasing the area through which it
passes. If the walls are drawn inward 1 foot for each 18 inches
of rise, friction is reduced and interference with the draft lessened.
The walls should be smooth inside, for roughness
seriously impedes the upward movement
of the air currents.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SHAPE_OF_THE_FIREPLACE"></a>SHAPE OF THE FIREPLACE.</p>

<p>The shape of the fireplace proper should be
as indicated in <a href="#fig13">figure 13-A</a>. The back should
pitch forward from a point a little less than
half way from the hearth to the top of the
opening, and the sides should be beveled as
indicated. Straight back and sides do not
radiate as much heat into the room.</p>

<p class="hanging">Fig. 16.&mdash;This construction without a throat
damper directs the down

the up draft almost at

more faulty than the
construction shown in

of the damper deflects
the down current.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_THROAT_DAMPER"></a>THE THROAT DAMPER.</p>

<p>A properly designed throat damper affords
a means of regulating the fire. The damper
consists of a cast-iron frame with a lid hinged
preferably at the back so that the width of the
throat opening may be varied from nothing to
6 inches. There are a number of patterns on
the market, some of which are designed to support
the masonry over the fireplace opening.</p>

<p>A roaring pine fire requires a full throat
opening, but slow-burning hardwood logs require
but 1 or 2 inches of opening. Regulating
the opening according to the kind of fire
prevents waste of heat up the chimney.
Closing the opening completely in summer keeps flies, mosquitoes,
and other insects from entering the house by way of the
chimney.</p>

<p>In houses heated by furnaces or other modern systems fireplaces
without throat dampers interfere with even heating, particularly in
very cold weather. An open fire must be supplied with air and the
larger the fire the greater the quantity required; a fireplace with
a width of 5 feet or more may pull air from distant parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
house. This air that is heated at the expenditure of fuel in the furnace
is carried up the chimney and wasted, but with a throat damper
open only 1 or 2 inches a slow fire of hardwood can be kept going
without smoking the room, thus reducing materially the waste of
hot air.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="PLACING_THE_THROAT_DAMPER"></a>PLACING THE THROAT DAMPER.</p>

<p>The throat damper should be as wide as the fireplace, so the side
walls should not be drawn in until after the throat is passed. Smoke
dampers with lid hinged at the back will help
the smoke shelf to turn the down draft; if the
lid is hinged in the center the downward and
upward currents are apt to conflict. The
placing of the damper varies with the type,
but generally the bottom of the frame is built
into the brickwork at the level of the top of
the fireplace opening, forming the throat and
supporting the masonry above it.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SIZE_OF_FIREPLACE_OPENING"></a>SIZE OF FIREPLACE OPENING.</p>

<p>Pleasing proportions in the fireplace opening
are desirable. The width should generally
be greater than the height, but as 30 inches
is about the minimum height consistent with
convenience in tending the fire, a narrow
opening may be made square. Three feet and
a half is a good maximum for height of opening
unless the fireplace is over 6 feet wide.
The higher the opening the greater the chance
of a smoky fireplace.</p>

<p>A fireplace should be in harmony with the
rest of the room in proportions and details.
This consideration and the kind of fuel to be used largely determine
the size of opening.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the day of large farmhouse fireplaces capable
of receiving cordwood is past. The tending of fires usually falls to
the housewife, and cordwood is a heavier weight than she should
handle and can not be stored near at hand. Cordwood cut in two
is easily handled; so that a 30-inch width is about the minimum for
farmhouses where wood is used for fuel. If coal is burned the opening
may be made narrower.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="DEPTH_OF_FIREPLACE_OPENING"></a>DEPTH OF FIREPLACE OPENING.</p>

<p>Unless a fireplace with a 6-foot opening is made fully 28 inches
deep, in order that large logs will lie well inside, the advantage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
the wide opening is lost, for the logs will have to be split. A shallow
opening throws out more heat than a deep one of the same width,
but can take only sticks of smaller diameter; thus it becomes a
question of preference between the greater depth which permits of
large logs that burn longer and require less frequent replenishing
and the shallower which takes lighter sticks and throws more heat.</p>

<p>In small fireplaces a depth of 12 inches will permit good draft if
the throat is constructed as explained above, but a minimum depth of
18 inches is advised, to lessen the danger of brands falling out on the
floor. Wire guards should be placed in front of all fireplaces. In
general, the wider the opening the greater should be the depth.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_HEARTH"></a>THE HEARTH.</p>

<p>The hearth should be flush with the floor, for sweepings may then
be brushed into the fireplace. An ash dump located in the hearth near
the back of the fireplace is convenient for clearing ashes and other
refuse from the hearth provided there is space below for an ash pit.
The dump consists of a cast-iron metal frame, with pivoted cover,
through which the refuse can be brushed into the ash pit below. The
ash pit should be of perfectly tight masonry and provided with a
tightly fitting cleanout door. If a warm-air flue, as described on
page 27, is provided, the ash dump will have to be located near one
side of the hearth instead of in the center.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_JAMBS"></a>THE JAMBS.</p>

<p>The jambs of the fireplace should be of sufficient width to give
stability to the structure both actually and in appearance. For a
fireplace opening 3 feet wide or less, 16 inches is generally sufficient;
for wider openings similar proportions should be kept. Greater
widths may be required to harmonize with the proportions of the
rooms, and the above should be taken as a minimum.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="FIREPLACE_BACK_AND_SIDES"></a>FIREPLACE BACK AND SIDES.</p>

<p>The back and sides of the fireplace should be constructed of firebrick
only. The bricks should be laid flat with the long sides exposed,
for if placed with the face exposed there is danger of their
falling out.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SUPPORTING_IRONS"></a>SUPPORTING IRONS.</p>

<p>In small fireplaces sagging of the arch over the opening seldom occurs,
but in fireplaces over 4 feet wide it is not uncommon. It is due
to insufficient support of the masonry. Except in massive construction
there generally is not sufficient masonry at the sides of the opening
to resist the thrust of arch construction; hence it is usual to support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
the masonry with iron, which, if too light, will sag. Too small
an iron will become so hot that its tensile strength is lowered until
it bends. A heavy flat bar at least one-half inch thick is sometimes
used or a T-bar which has greater strength, but less metal; the wider
the opening the heavier the bar required.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="IMPROVING_FIREPLACE_HEATING"></a>IMPROVING FIREPLACE HEATING.</p>

<p>A number of patents have been obtained for improvements in fireplace
heating. Most of them, depending on the fact that hot air rises,
deliver air heated in or around the fireplace through a register, located
above the fire, into the upper part of the room, which is always
the warmest part. Furthermore, they require a specially built chimney,
precluding the installation of such a device in an existing fireplace.
Unless fresh outside air is supplied there is no improvement
in the warming of the room.</p>

<p>Patent No. 1251916, issued to Joseph Parsons, of Lakeville, Conn.,
and by him assigned to the United States Government, presents
means of greatly increasing the efficiency of fireplace heating. The
inventor&rsquo;s claim differs from other claims for improving fireplace
heating in that the operation of his device depends upon the suction
created in the chimney by the hot air rising from the fireplace and
therefore makes possible the delivery of heated air through a register
located at any place in the room or at the hearth. Furthermore, it
permits of installation of one of the simpler types in an existing
chimney.</p>

<p>For a fire to burn it must be supplied with oxygen. If a fire were
built in a fireplace in an air-tight room it would go out as soon as the
oxygen present had been consumed unless a down draft in the chimney
supplied the needed air. As our fireplace fires do not go out so
long as they are fed with fuel it is obvious that the required air
supply is obtained from somewhere. Any one who has depended
upon a fireplace to heat a room knows that the part of the room
farthest from the fire is the coldest and that the temperature around
the windows is especially low. In fact the harder the fire burns the
colder it is at the windows. The fire must have air, and as cracks
exist around windows and doors the air enters through them. The
volume entering is equal to that passing up the chimney. This air
comes from outside at a low temperature. <a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a> illustrates how
a fireplace fire supplies its needs. When it grows colder outside a
bigger fire is made. The bigger the blaze the greater the quantity
of outside air drawn into the room through every crack and crevice
until, when the outside temperature gets below the freezing point,
there is no comfort in the room beyond the immediate vicinity of the
fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 540px;">

<div class="fig_caption">
<p class="hanging">Fig. 18.&mdash;All air required for feeding the fire must pass through the room, entering
through cracks around windows and doors and producing an uncomfortable temperature
in all parts of the room except near the hearth.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>If a room were so tight that the air leakage were insufficient to
supply a fireplace fire, it would not burn properly and would smoke.
If a pane of glass were removed from a window cold air would rush
in through the opening. If the glass were replaced and an opening
of equal area be made through the chimney, as shown in <a href="#fig19">figures 19</a>,
A and B, so that air could be admitted into the room as indicated
by the arrows in the plan, <a href="#fig19">figure 19-B</a>, an equal volume of cold air
would be drawn through this opening. As it comes into contact with
the metal form the air becomes heated, so that when delivered into
the room its temperature would be 100 degrees or higher, depending
upon the radiating surface of the hearth, assuming an outside temperature
of 32 degrees. (Tests by the writer have shown this temperature
to be higher than 125 degrees.) If the chimney opening
be closed and the pane of glass be again removed the temperature
of the air entering through the window would be 32 degrees. It is
obvious that the room will be more effectually heated when the air
required for combustion is supplied at a high temperature than
when supplied through cracks and crevices at a low temperature.
All our homes should be made fairly tight for greater comfort in
winter. In such a house, with doors and windows closed, the suction
caused by the fire can thus be utilized to draw into the room outside
air heated in passing through a metal flue on which the fire is
burning.</p>

<p>The principle may be applied in various forms. <a href="#fig19">Figure 19-A</a> illustrates
a simple form for use in connection with an outside chimney.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
A piece of galvanized sheet iron is bent to the proper form and set
into the fireplace so as to leave an air space between it and the back
and sides of the fireplace. An opening to the outside is made by
removing two or three courses of brick. Air enters
through this, becomes heated by contact with the
metal, and is delivered into the room at the sides
of the fireplace, as indicated in the plan of <a href="#fig18">figure
19-B</a>. It immediately rises within the room, gives
up part of its heat, and eventually whirls about and
into the fire, as indicated by the arrows in f<a href="#fig19">igure
19-A</a>. This form would not necessarily heat the
entire room effectually; it would, however, supply
heated air for the fire in volume sufficient to
replace or materially reduce the quantity of cold
air which would otherwise enter through window and door cracks.
With a brisk fire burning, a rush of warm air can be felt 6 or 8 feet
away from the fireplace.</p>

<p class="hanging">Fig. 19.&mdash;Simple form of warm-air flue for outside chimney. Air required for feeding
the fire is brought in from the outside around a metal form set in the fireplace, with
a space between it and the back and sides of the brickwork. As the cold outside air
passes around the metal it becomes heated and is delivered into the room at a temperature
much higher than where it is pulled in through window and door cracks. The
result is a much more comfortable room.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span></p>

<p>This simple form may be built as follows: A piece of roofing tin
about 6 inches wider than the height of the fireplace opening, with
length equal to the width of the opening plus twice the depth of the
side, should be secured. It should then be marked and cut as indicated
in the form (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19-B</a>), and bent into a shape similar to that
shown in the perspective, same figure. When placing it, there should
be a space left between the tin and the brickwork at both back and
top. The back and sides at the top should be bent back 2 inches to
meet the brickwork. The crack or joint should be tightly closed with
asbestos or furnace cement. The tin form rests on the 4-inch bottom
flange. The joint here can be made tight by placing a few brick on
the flange and covering with ashes, or a metal plate cut to the proper
shape may be laid upon and preferably riveted to the lower flanges
of the back and sides. The form should be as high as the opening and
the metal sides should project about 3 inches beyond the jambs, so as to
throw the heated air well out into the room. A one-fourth-inch rod
placed across the top of the tin form directly under the arch iron of
the fireplace assists in holding the top of the tin firmly against the
brickwork.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a> shows a simple form for use with an inside chimney.
A hole may be cut in the hearth on one side and connected with the
outside by means of a passage through the chimney foundation. The
manner of providing this passage will depend upon the construction
in the particular case. A galvanized sheet-metal box with a division
plate extending part way through it is set on the hearth. The side
over the opening is bent down in front, as at A, so that the entering
cold air must pass to the rear around the division plate and then out
into the room in front of the hearth, as at B. The fire, on top of the
metal flue, heats the air issuing at B as it flows under it. <a href="#fig21">Figure 21</a>
shows an improved form in which the flue and division plate are extended
up the back of the fireplace. This presents considerably more
radiating surface, so that the air can be heated to a higher temperature.
The air issuing from this flue at B is discharged farther out
into the room. If there is a cellar under the floor a metal duct must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
be employed to bring fresh air from an opening in the outside wall,
just below the joists, to the hole in the hearth. Cellar air should
never be sucked through the flue. All openings under the house or
through the wall should be screened to keep out rats and mice, and
doors should be provided to close the openings entirely if desired.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 592px;">

<div class="fig_caption">
<p class="hanging">Fig. 22.&mdash;Improved form of warm-air flue with floor register. This method increases the
efficiency of fireplaces many times by delivering the air that must be supplied to the
fire into the room at temperatures of 100&deg; and higher, depending upon the form and
extent of the heating surface at the back of the fireplace, and delivering it to the coldest
part of the room so that heat is distributed more effectively and the entrance of
cold air around windows and doors is reduced to a minimum.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a> shows a more elaborate installation. This insures very
satisfactory heating with a fireplace fire. The piece A B C D of
galvanized metal has a rectangular cross section. Two or three
courses of brickwork are omitted and the metal duct is set into the
fireplace, so that radiation from the fire impinges upon its surface
from B to D. The air entering from outside at AE is heated as it
passes through the flue behind and under the fire and is carried
through another rectangular duct under the floor to a register located
in a far part of the room. Out of this register air in large volume
is discharged at a high temperature. This air heats the far part
of the room and other parts as it travels from the register upward
and through the room to the fireplace. Thus the fireplace heats the
room by convection of heat as well as by radiation, and all parts of
the room are more comfortable than if radiation alone were depended
upon. A test of an installation similar to that shown in
<a href="#fig22">figure 22</a> was made by the writer. The fireplace and suction flue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
were built in a cabin measuring 24 feet square by 9 feet high. The
test was conducted late in November on a night when the outside
temperature was 24&deg; F. It was the first fire built in the fireplace
in that season, consequently all the materials of the building were
cold. The room was practically air-tight; very little leakage could
be felt around the windows. A temperature of slightly over 100&deg;
was recorded directly over the register, in the center of the room it
was 72&deg;, and in the farthest corner a thermometer, hung about 18
inches from the wall between two windows, showed 65&deg;.</p>

<p>Thus the efficiency of fireplaces may be materially increased, the
degree depending upon the character of the air duct installed.
Even in the simple types the air required to make the fire burn
enters the room at a higher temperature at the floor instead of
around windows and doors at a low temperature; windows and doors
may therefore be made tight, so as to reduce the cold-air leakage.
The type with a register in the far part of the room supplies heat
to parts of the room or to an adjoining room, which would receive
little heat if radiation only were relied upon. This means of improving
fireplace heating is particularly adapted to small houses in
the South, where the open fire is the most common method of house
heating. As the simple types require only galvanized Sheet metal
bent at right angles, it is within the means and ability of many to
supply themselves with flues of their own making.</p>
